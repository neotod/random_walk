# Random Walk

This is a representation of Random Walk in Probablity theory. In this notebook I only generated and plotted Simple Random Walk, which in that, Particle's step size is an integer and the probablities of moving in either directions (x, y or z) are equal.

One of the applications of Random Walk is using it to model and solve Gambler's ruin problem.
